        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is TJ and I’m making a significant life change in order
          to join the world of software engineering by attending the University
          of Denver’s Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This is an exciting
          opportunity and I’m looking forward to a rewarding career full of
          challenges and problem solving. In the past, I worked in both the
          construction and climbing gym industries. I built everything from wine
          cellars to cell phone towers and developed climbing programs for
          multiple non-profits, in addition to working for several climbing
          gyms. In my free time, I enjoy finding adventures in nature. Whether
          it is climbing, hiking, or fishing, I love the sun on my face.
        </p>

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>

        <p>
          While working in the indoor climbing industry, I organized and
          implemented climbing programs for multiple non-profits. As an
          assistant manager, I was a key member of the high school climbing
          league at a large climbing gym. I played an integral role in launching
          a Colorado Springs bouldering gym. Additionally, I consulted with
          several other facilities to help them develop outdoor recreation
          programs. At the end of 2020, I felt the need for a new challenge and
          decided to change careers. This need inspired me to pursue software
          engineering and I enrolled in the University of Denver Full Stack
          Coding Bootcamp. I am excited to learn new skills that will allow me
          solve coding problems and bring valuable skills to a tech company.
        </p>
