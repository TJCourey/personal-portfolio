# personal-portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio which I plan on using to display the projects and activities I learn in my bootcamp program for future employment. It is a great centralized location to display my works as well as agood excercise in using HTML and CSS.

## Usage

The portfolio can be viewed at https://tjcourey.github.io/personal-portfolio/ and I have attached a screenshot of it running in my browser.
